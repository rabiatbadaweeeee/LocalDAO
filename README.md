# LocalDAO
 LocalDAO is a blockchain-based platform that empowers local communities to participate in transparent, efficient, and democratic decision-making processes. By leveraging smart contracts and tokenized voting rights, the platform creates a bridge between traditional local governance and decentralized autonomous organizations.
